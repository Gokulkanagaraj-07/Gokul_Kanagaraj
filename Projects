2.PacketSniffer:
 
    A packet sniffer is a tool or software used to capture and analyze data packets
traveling across a computer network. Data transmitted over a network is broken into 
smaller units called packets, which are reassembled at the receiving end. Packet sniffing 
involves intercepting these packets to examine their contents.
