Hi, 

 I am GOKUL K from Dharmapuri. I have done my schooling at Variyar Hr.Sec School, 
Dharmapuri. I belong to a nuclear family. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Engineering 
in Cybersecurity at Paavai Engineering college. During my studies, I developed strong skills 
in networking, various security frameworks, ethical hacking, and crime investigation in 
digital forensics.

 I recently earned a certificate as Cybersecurity Analyst at CISCO, which has enhanced
my skills in Threat Management, Network Security & Defense, Endpoint Security and 
vulnerability Detection.

 I have also completed an internship at Navedita Infotech. And I have gained hands-on
experience in cybersecurity beam operations. And in my free time, I have worked on
small-scale simulated attacks and defense Labs conducted vulnerability assessments using 
tools like Nmap Wireshark, Burp suite and also Kali Linux. I gained hands-on experience
with real-time cyberattacks and data breach prevention.

 I am passionate about cybersecurity and related attack prevention, and I have been
involved in phishing Awareness to students in non-technical domains.

 And I'm proud to have various badges from various global organizations, like Cisco, IBM,
and Fortinet.

 I am at Good communication, problem-solving, critical thinking and able to adapt to any
environment.

 My hobbies are watching crime investigation and sci-fi movies, and setting a small goal 
for upcoming tasks and targets. I am a quick learner and believe in learning from my past
mistakes and experiences.

 My short-time goal is to become the Top 1% on the TryHackMÐµ platform and a VAPT Analyst.
My long-time goal is to secure this digital world from cyber threats and cyber criminals.

 Thank youðŸ˜Š
